### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Lecturer and researcher in computational biology at Deakin University, Australia. Our group is focused on building data resources and software tools to accelerate biomedical discovery. We work collaborate closely with clinicians and biologists to get the most out of their 'omics experiments. Our lab is committed to reproducibility, open science, and diversity.

Topic areas of interest:

* Transcriptome analysis

* Multi-omics/epigenomics

* Enrichment analysis

* Scientific rigour
